# Autonomous Agents
This is a Windows Forms application that simulates the behavior of boids in a 2D space. Boids are entities that follow a set of rules to achieve various different behaviours. This simulation provides a visual representation of how these behaviors work.

## Behavior Options
You can choose between different behavior options to change the way boids behave. The target is the mouse cursor.
* Seeking and Arriving: Boids seek a target point and arrive at it.
* Wandering: Boids wander aimlessly with a specified wandering distance.
* Seperate: Boids avoid each other and travel in opposite directions from one another.
* Seperate and Seek: Boids avoid each other but also seek a target point.
* Seperate and Wander: Boids avoid each other but also wander aimlessly.
* Flocking: Boids exhibit flocking behavior, including separation, alignment, and cohesion.

You can also customize the number of boids and toggle wall avoidance to see how boids avoid colliding with walls(the edges of the screen).
